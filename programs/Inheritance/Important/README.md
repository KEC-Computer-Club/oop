Create a class student with data members studen ID and name. Create class internal exam with marks first as data member and external exam with marks second. Create class result by inheriting class internal exam and external exam that will add marks of class internal exam and external exam.
- [ ] [q3](q3.cpp): WAP to show order of constructor(default, parameterized) and destructor call in multiple inheritance. Base class one ename and class two have employee id and child class result.
- [ ] [q4](q4.cpp): WAP to convert object from class that represent weight of gold in Nepal, tola to object of a class that represent internal gold measurement of weight in gram scale.
- [ ] [q5](q5.cpp): WAP with three classes students, test, and result by using multi level inheritance. Assume necessary member and function yourself and program with input information input data and calculate marks total and display result.
